          I am a <span>full-stack developer</span> who took the long way around.
          I graduated in 2020 with a degree in International Development. During
          COVID I decided to start my journey as a web developer. I taught
          myself web development through The Odin Project, where I created over
          30 projects of various complexities.{" "}
